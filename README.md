# * Introduction



In this project, i am going to fetch JSON data from an CAtAPI and show it in a list view in SwiftUI. 
I will discuss how I structure my code base with MVVM (Model - View Model - View). 
Also I am including an extra layer for the networking logic because it helps make my code more reusable and write unit tests.
I will also learn about error handling  with URLSession and how to show error information to the user.
